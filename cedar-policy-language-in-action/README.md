# Cedar policy language in action

[Cedar policy language in action](https://catalog.workshops.aws/cedar-policy-language-in-action) is hosted on workshops.aws and provides a Cedar tutorial and a set of challenge problems.  This is free to use and leverages the [Cedar Playground](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en/playground).

After completing the tutorial, apply your knowledge to create the Cedar policies and entity data which implement simple versions of a Photo Application and a Source Code Management Application.  Hints are available in the workshop, and the solutions are also viewable at [PhotoApp](PhotoApp) and [GitApp](GitApp).
