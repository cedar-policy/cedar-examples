# Cedar OOPSLA 2024 Benchmarks

This folder contains the benchmark policies used in the evaluation of the [OOPSLA2024 paper on Cedar](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649835).
There are three benchmarks: `gdrive` and `github` come from <https://github.com/openfga/sample-stores> and `tinytodo` is based on Cedar's [TinyTodo example](../tinytodo/). Each of these benchmarks includes the example encoded in Cedar, OpenFGA, and Rego. We also include alternate versions of `gdrive` and `github` that use policy templates (for Cedar only).
